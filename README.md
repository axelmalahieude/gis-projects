# gis-projects
Collection of GIS (Geographic Information Systems) projects completed in courses at UCLA, using mainly ArcMap and QGIS. Most recent projects come first.
Though I am studying computer science, I found myself very interested in GIS.

## Cost-Distance Analysis: Finding a Possible Highway Route through the Darien Gap
* Analyzes forests, bodies of water, and terrain slope to find a viable route between Panama and Columbia
* Tools used: Cost-distance, raster analysis and reclassification
* Map 1: General map of routes
* Map 2: Routes with respect to forested areas
* Map 3: Routes with respect to terrain slope

## Viewshed Analysis: Determining the Best Ways to Expand T-Mobile Service in LA County
* Analyzes 3 possible scenarios to boost cell coverage: increasing cell tower height, increasing cell tower range, introducing 3 new cell towers
* Tools used: viewshed analysis, raster analysis and mosaicking
* Map 1: Current T-Mobile coverage
* Map 2: Coverage if we increased tower height
* Map 2: Coverage if we increased tower range
* Map 2: Coverage if we added 3 towers
